# EffySocial API Reference (live)

The **implemented** backend endpoints. Base: `/api/effy` (proxied by nginx on
effysocial.effybiz.in → Flask `novalab-engine`). Auth is a signed session
cookie (`effy_uid`). Update this file whenever an endpoint ships.

Legend: 🔓 no auth · 🔒 requires session · 🏢 org-ownership enforced

## Brand Brain  ([Brand-Brain.md](modules/Brand-Brain.md))
| Method | Path | Auth | Body → Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/effy/brand?workspace=ws_N` | 🔒🏢 | → `{brain}` — default template overlaid with stored facts + sources |
| POST | `/api/effy/brand/fact` | 🔒🏢 | `{workspace, section, data, status?, sources?, kind?}` → `{status}` (upsert per section) |

**Brain shape:** `{ completeness, needsReview, lastUpdated, <section>:{status, sources[], data} }` where sections = summary, tone, approved, prohibited, products, offers, personas, faqs, objections, competitors, visual, legal, sources. `data` shape varies by section kind (paragraph/chips/list/personas/faqs/visual/sources).

## AI Studio  ([AI-Studio.md](modules/AI-Studio.md))
| Method | Path | Auth | Body → Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/effy/studio/generate` | 🔒🏢 | `{workspace, type, topic, language?}` → `{caption, hook, cta, hashtags[], scores[], cited[], platform}` |

Grounded in the workspace's Brand Brain (tone/approved/prohibited). `type` ∈ {ig_post, ig_carousel, ig_reel, fb_post, li_post, x_post, yt_short, wa_promo}. **Scores are computed** (brand alignment, hook, CTA, platform fit, readability, ad-policy risk) each with a `note` and `invert` flag — real, explainable, not fabricated.

| POST | `/api/effy/posts/:id/schedule` | 🔒🏢 | `{date?, time?}` → scheduled (only from approved/failed; failed retry clears error) |

**Post shape:** `{ id, workspaceId, campaignId?, title, channel, type, status, date, time, assignee, caption, metrics?, comments[], error }` · statuses: idea/draft/internal_review/client_review/approved/scheduled/published/failed.

## Engage  ([Engage-Inbox.md](modules/Engage-Inbox.md))
| Method | Path | Auth | Body → Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/effy/conversations?workspace=ws_N` | 🔒🏢 | → `{conversations:[...]}` |

## Analytics
| Method | Path | Auth | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/effy/analytics/organic?workspace=ws_N` | 🔒🏢 | `{provider:"derived", kpis, followerSeries, reachSeries, topPosts, demographics, bestTimes, insights}` |

Top posts + reach/engagement KPIs **aggregate real `effy_posts` metrics**; series/demographics are deterministic derived values (flagged `provider:"derived"`) until social integrations sync real snapshots.

## Effy AI  ([Effy-AI.md](modules/Effy-AI.md))
| Method | Path | Auth | Body → Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/effy/assistant/chat` | 🔒🏢 | `{workspace, message, history?}` → `{reply, agent, citations[], actions[{label,route}]}` · 400 no message · 503 Groq down |
| GET | `/api/effy/assistant/recommendations?workspace=ws_N` | 🔒🏢 | → `{recommendations:[{id, agent, severity, title, detected, why, action, impact, confidence, needsApproval, route}]}` |

Chat: deterministic keyword router picks one of 8 agents; the Groq reply is grounded ONLY in a live snapshot of the workspace (campaigns w/ KPIs, post pipeline, open conversations, unanswered reviews, brand tone) — inventing numbers is forbidden in the prompt. Recommendations are **rule-based detections** (budget pacing >90%, CPL >₹400, failed publishes, open complaints, negative reviews, calendar gaps) shaped per spec §3.3; spend-affecting ones carry `needsApproval:true` (§3.4).

## Convert — Leads  ([Convert-Leads.md](modules/Convert-Leads.md))
| Method | Path | Auth | Body → Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/effy/leads?workspace=ws_N` | 🔒🏢 | → `{leads:[...]}` |

| POST | `/api/effy/conversations/:id/convert-lead` | 🔒🏢 write-role | → `{lead, existing}` — idempotent; copies person/channel/interest, sales-intent → hot |

**Lead shape:** `{ id, workspaceId, campaignId?, conversationId?, name, phone, email, source, channel, interest, stage, quality, value, owner, notes[], lostReason, created }` · stages: new/contacted/qualified/appointment/proposal/won/lost.

## Planned (not yet implemented)
Brand Brain **RAG over uploaded docs** (pgvector, enabled in DB) pending an embedding provider · RBAC per-feature enforcement · Effy AI agents · Phase-2 modules (Advertise/Convert). This file gets a new section as each ships.
